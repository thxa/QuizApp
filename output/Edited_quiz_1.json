On the other hand  option D involves installing and configuring the Amazon CloudWatch agent  creating a CloudWatch log group  setting up a CloudWatch Logs subscription  and configuring an Amazon Kinesis Data Firehose delivery stream to store logs in an S3 bucket. This requires additional setup and management compared to option",

Use AWS Transfer Family to create an FTP server to store incoming files in Amazon S3 Standard. Create an AWS Lambda function to process the files and to delete the files after they are processed. Use an S3 event notification to invoke the Lambda function when the files arrive."

    "explain": "Process incoming data files with minimal changes to the FTP clients that send the files = AWS Transfer Family. Process incoming data files as soon as possible = S3 event notification. Processing for each file needs to take 3-8 minutes = AWS Lambda function. Delete file after processing = AWS Lambda function.",

    "question": "53 A company is migrating its workloads to AWS. The company has transactional and sensitive data in its databases. The company wants to use AWS Cloud solutions to increase security and reduce operational overhead for the databases. Which solution will meet these requirements?",
    "options": [
      "A. Migrate the databases to Amazon EC2. Use an AWS Key Management Service (AWS KMS) AWS managed key for encryption.\nB. Migrate the databases to Amazon RDS Configure encryption at rest.\nC. Migrate the data to Amazon S3 Use Amazon Macie for data security and protection\nD. Migrate the database to Amazon RDS. Use Amazon CloudWatch Logs for data security and protection."

    "explain": "Option C suggests migrating the data to Amazon S3 and using Amazon Macie for data security and protection. While Amazon Macie provides advanced security features for data in S3, it may not be directly applicable or optimized for databases, especially for transactional and sensitive data. Amazon RDS provides a more suitable environment for managing databases.",

The company uses Amazon Route 53 to point the application traffic to multiple Network Load Balancers (NLBs) in different AWS Regions. The company needs to improve application performance and decrease latency for the online game in preparation for user growth. Which solution will meet these requirements?",
    "options": [
      "A. Add an Amazon CloudFront distribution in front of the NLBs. Increase the Cache-Control max-age parameter.\nB. Replace the NLBs with Application Load Balancers (ALBs). Configure Route 53 to use latency-based routing.\nC. Add AWS Global Accelerator in front of the NLBs. Configure a Global Accelerator endpoint to use the correct listener ports.\nD. Add an Amazon API Gateway endpoint behind the NLBs. Enable API caching. Override method caching for the different stages."
